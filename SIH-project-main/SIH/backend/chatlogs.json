{"timestamp":"2025-09-10T01:14:24.928Z","user":"rumtek","bot":"Rumtek Monastery (Rumtek Gompa) is the largest and most important Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Sikkim.  \n- **Location**: 10 km south of Gangtok, perched on a hill overlooking the town.  \n- **History**: Founded in 1692 by the 5th Dalai Lama and later expanded by the 9th and 10th Dalai Lamas.  \n- **Highlights**: The main temple (Chokhor) houses a 17‑meter‑tall gold‑leaf Buddha, a 7‑meter‑tall statue of the 10th Dalai Lama, and a beautiful 5‑tiered stupa. The monastery also hosts the annual Rumtek Fair and the Tibetan New Year celebrations.  \n\nIf you’re planning a visit, the best time is April–June or September–November when the weather is mild and the views are clear. Remember to respect local customs—dress modestly, keep noise low, and ask permission before photographing monks or sacred spaces."}
